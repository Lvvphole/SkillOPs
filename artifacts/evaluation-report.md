# Evaluation Report

Evaluator scoring against the contract success criteria. Pass/fail here is
mechanical: it cites files, logs, and artifacts, never agent narration.

## Success criteria scorecard

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |

| 20 | Metrics decide pass/fail | ✅ | `compare_thresholds`, tests |
| 21 | LLM only suggests; verified | ✅ | `recommendations/`, `constrain_recommendation` |
| 22 | Corrective patch = new version + changelog | ✅ | `create_skill_version`, `write_changelog` |
| 23–24 | Candidate only on evidence-backed improvement; PR gate | ✅ | `verify_candidate`, `recommend_candidate` |
| 25 | Verifier rejects unsafe/unsupported/self-cert | ✅ | `verification/*`, tests |
| 26–27 | Tests exist & pass; log saved | ✅ | 44 passed; `artifacts/test-results.log` |
| 28 | Build/validation passes; log saved | ✅ | `artifacts/build-results.log` |
| 29 | Required artifacts generated | ✅ | `artifacts/*` |
| 30 | Final diff captured | ✅ | `artifacts/final-diff.patch` |

| 32 | Committed with required message | ✅ | `feat: add manifest-driven SkillOps loop runtime` |
| 33 | Branch pushed | ✅ | see `artifacts/pr-url.txt` |
| 34–36 | PR created with full documentation | ✅ | `artifacts/pr-summary.md`, PR body |
| 37–38 | Verifier approves; no open correction/escalation | ✅ | `verification-report.md` |

## Live loop terminal state
`PASS_NO_CHANGE_RECORDED` — a valid terminal state (not "done"/"looks good").
Demonstrates that a passing skill still triggers maintenance + optimization.

## Pull request
PR URL: see `artifacts/pr-url.txt` (also printed in the final handoff). This
report is updated with the URL once the PR is opened.

## Evaluator verdict
No unresolved correction or escalation remains. Implementation matches the
Python-first manifest-driven SkillOps v1 contract.
